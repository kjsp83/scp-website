              SCP-6683-A is a 78 year old caucasian male of Italian descent. Visually, SCP-6683-A displays no particularly noteworthy features. He possesses olive skin, greyed hair, and brown eyes. SCP-6683-A’s skin is also considerably wrinkled, though this merely reflects his stated age. 
              <br><br>SCP-6683-A’s anomalous ability manifests upon the utterance of an idiom. Once SCP-6683-A finishes saying an idiom, an anomalous effect tangentially or directly related to the contents of said idiom will manifest and affect the nearest person within a roughly 1 kilometer radius. The effects of this ability can range from mildly beneficial to catastrophically dangerous, though they tend to only affect the individual closest to SCP-6683-A (footnote: Exceptions to this rule have been noted). Should two or more individuals stand at the same closest distance away from SCP-6683-A, they are both affected by his ability. 
              <br><br>For unknown reasons, SCP-6683-A appears to be compelled to constantly say idioms, either to himself or others, and does not seem to be able to control himself from doing so. SCP-6683-A also does not appear to be able to perceive his own anomalous properties, claiming ignorance of the effect should he be confronted with it. Interestingly, SCP-6683-A will completely forget the existence of anyone killed by his or SCP-6683-B’s effect, despite having known some for months or even years prior to their death. SCP-6683-A’s effect also does not affect his immediate family, for reasons heretofore unknown.
